## 🔧 Technologies Used

- [React](https://react.dev/) - UI library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type safety
- [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) - File-based routing
- [TanStack React Start](https://tanstack.com/start) - Server-side rendering
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [Vinxi](https://vinxi.vercel.app/) - Build system
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - Testing framework

## 📝 How It Works

DevJokes uses a simple file-based JSON storage system to store and retrieve jokes. The application leverages TanStack Router for routing and TanStack React Start for server-side rendering.

### Adding a Joke

1. Enter a joke question and answer in the form
2. Submit the form to add the joke to the collection
3. The joke is stored in a JSON file on the server
4. The UI automatically updates to display the new joke

### Server Actions

The application uses server actions to:
- Fetch jokes from the server
- Add new jokes to the collection
- Delete jokes from the collection
